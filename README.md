## Contents of this repository

Files and scripts from procect files.

**1- Data Modeling:** tbd 

**2 - Cloud Data Warehouses:** tbd

**3 - Spark & Data Lakes:**
In this project a data lake containing songplay-data from *Sparkify* and a corresponding ETL is constructed using EMR, S3 and Spark. Data is extracted from a S3 bucket, transformed data warehouse tables with Spark on EMR and safed as parquet-files.

**4 - Automate Data Pipelines:** tbd

**5 - Capstone Project:** 
This project designs an analytical dataware house and corresponding ETLs for the bicycle sharing system *Citi Bikes* in New York City. The project combines bike trip data provided Citi Bikes with weather data of New York City. Data is extracted from a S3 bucket and an API, transformed into six data warehouse table with Spark and safed as parquet-files.
